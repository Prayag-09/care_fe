# CARE Frontend

CARE is a Digital Public Good enabling TeleICU & Decentralised Administration of Healthcare Capacity across States. This is a React + TypeScript + Vite frontend application for the healthcare management system.

## Important: Trust These Instructions
Always reference these instructions first and fallback to search or bash commands only when you encounter unexpected information that does not match the info here. This repository has custom setup requirements and workflows that must be followed exactly.

## Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack
- Frontend Framework: React 19.1.1 with TypeScript
- Build Tool: Vite 6.3.5 for fast development and optimized builds
- Styling: Tailwind CSS 4.1.3 with custom healthcare-specific design system
- UI Components: shadcn/ui as primary system, CAREUI for healthcare-specific components
- State Management: @tanstack/react-query for server state, React hooks for client state
- Routing: raviger for application routing
- Forms: react-hook-form with zod validation for medical data integrity
- Internationalization: i18next for multi-language healthcare interfaces
- Testing: Cypress for E2E testing of critical healthcare workflows

### Project Structure
- `src/components/` - React components organized by feature and domain
- `src/CAREUI/` - Healthcare-specific component library
- `src/pages/` - Page-level components and routing
- `src/Utils/` - Utility functions and helpers
- `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions for medical data
- `cypress/` - End-to-end tests for healthcare workflows

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Accessibility
Healthcare applications must meet enhanced accessibility standards:
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance: Required for medical applications
- Screen reader compatibility: Medical data must be accessible via assistive technology  
- Keyboard navigation: Full keyboard support for clinical environments
- High contrast support: Visibility in various clinical lighting conditions
- Focus management: Clear focus indicators for complex medical workflows

### Internationalization
Multi-language support for global healthcare deployment:
- i18n Strings: All literal strings must use i18next
- Language files: English Locale files are in `public/locale/en.json`
- Locale files for Non-English languages should not be edited directly, Managed via Crowdin,
- Date/time formats: Localized formatting for medical timestamps

## Coding Standards

### Code Quality
- TypeScript: Use strict TypeScript configuration for medical data safety
- ESLint: Follow configured rules for React hooks, accessibility, and code quality
- Prettier: Consistent code formatting across the healthcare application
- Component patterns: Follow established patterns in existing codebase

### Data Handling
- Type safety: Strict typing for all medical data structures and API interfaces
- Validation: Use zod schemas for runtime validation of medical data
- Error handling: Comprehensive error boundaries and user-friendly error messages
- Logging: Appropriate logging for medical workflow debugging without exposing PHI

### Documentation Requirements
- Component documentation: Include medical use cases and accessibility notes
- API documentation: Document medical data flows and validation requirements
- Accessibility notes: Document WCAG compliance and medical device compatibility
- Medical context: Explain healthcare workflows and clinical reasoning in code comments

## Working Effectively

### Environment Setup
- Node.js 22+ is required (check `.node-version` file)
- Install Node.js 22: `curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash - && sudo apt-get install -y nodejs`
- Or use nvm: `nvm install 22 && nvm use 22`

### Bootstrap, Build, and Test the Repository
- `npm install --ignore-scripts` -- installs dependencies without Cypress binary (takes ~16 seconds)
- `npm run postinstall` -- installs platform-specific dependencies and generates headers (takes ~3 seconds)
- `npm run setup` -- generates plugin map and setup (takes ~1 second)
- `npm run build` -- production build. NEVER CANCEL: Takes 2+ minutes. Set timeout to 180+ seconds.
- `npm run dev` -- starts development server on http://localhost:4000 (takes ~5 seconds)
- `npm run preview` -- starts production preview server (requires build first)

### Linting and Formatting
- `npm run lint` -- runs ESLint. Takes 85+ seconds. Set timeout to 120+ seconds.
- `npm run lint-fix` -- runs ESLint with auto-fix
- `npm run format` -- formats code with Prettier (takes ~19 seconds)
- `npm run unimported` -- checks for unused imports (takes ~7 seconds)

### Testing
- Cypress E2E Testing:
  - `npm run cypress:install` -- FAILS due to network restrictions. Document this limitation.
  - `npm run cypress:open` -- opens Cypress UI (requires backend setup)
  - `npm run cypress:run` -- runs all tests headlessly (requires backend setup)
  - `npm run cypress:run:gui` -- runs tests in headed mode
- Testing requires local backend: Follow [CARE backend setup docs](https://github.com/ohcnetwork/care#self-hosting)
- Environment setup for testing:
  ```env
  REACT_CARE_API_URL=https://care-api.do.ohc.network
  ```

## Validation

### Manual Validation Requirements
- ALWAYS run through complete development workflow after making changes:
  1. `npm install --ignore-scripts && npm run postinstall && npm run setup`
  2. `npm run dev` -- verify development server starts and loads at http://localhost:4000
  3. `npm run build` -- NEVER CANCEL: Takes 2+ minutes
  4. `npm run preview` -- verify production build works
  5. Test basic UI functionality (login page, navigation)

  ### Build Time Expectations
  - npm install (with --ignore-scripts): up to 30 seconds
  - npm run postinstall: up to 8 seconds  
  - npm run setup: up to 3 seconds
  - npm run build: up to 3 minutes (NEVER CANCEL, Set timeout to 180+ seconds; may take longer on slower machines)
  - npm run lint: up to 2 minutes (Set timeout to 120+ seconds; allow extra time on low-resource environments)
  - npm run format: up to 40 seconds
  - npm run dev: up to 12 seconds to start server (depends on system performance)

### Required Validation Steps
- Always run `npm run format` and `npm run lint` before committing changes
- The CI pipeline (.github/workflows/linter.yml) runs `npm run lint -- --quiet` and `npm run unimported`
- Application loads successfully showing CARE healthcare facility search and login interface
- Build produces a functional PWA with service worker

## Key Dependencies & Tools

### Additional Dependencies
- @tanstack/react-query for API state management
- react-query is 
- raviger for routing
- i18next for internationalization
- date-fns for date handling
- zod for schema validation
